					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"THE OCTOPUS IN TROUBLE"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>Once upon a time, there was a shy and quiet octopus. He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious.
							One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help untie all those tentacles from all those suckers.
							The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish.
							A couple of days later, the octopus was resting between some rocks when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared go near it. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid.
							Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish and swam back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down!
							Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch, first in his gills, then in his fins, and then all over his body.It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature. He loved colours and had developed a severe allergy to the octopus' dark ink! So the big fish swam away, irritated all over.
							As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came out and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone to be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.
							A moment to reflect
							Have you thought about how many friendly and kind fish should live close to the octopus' home that she will never meet if she does not become less shy? As the octopus did, if you can't talk directly to others, you can "talk" using friendly gestures instead, like smiling or saying "thank you."
							Let's talk!
							If you were a shy child, you can tell your kid what you felt, how you overcame your shyness, and the positive effects of that change.
							Why don't you try this?
							To begin to overcome shyness, I suggest you build an aquarium. It can be an actual aquarium, a virtual one on your smartphone, or one drawn on a piece of paper. Whenever your child talks to a stranger, even to say "hello," you can add a new fish to your aquarium. These small steps will make it easier for your child to overcome her fears.</p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"THE OLD MAN OF THE VILLAGE "</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text"><p><h4>An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood. The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour . An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up. The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked.  What happened to you . the old man replied. Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.
						moral of the story . Don’t chase happiness. Enjoy your life with what you have .</h4></p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"BEST FRIENDS"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand. Today my best friend slapped me in the face. They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone. Today my best friend saved my life. The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him.  After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why. The other friend replied. When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it. 
							Moral of the story. 
							Don’t value the things you have in your life. But value the person who you have in your life.</p>

						<p>People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time. One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter. After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled. When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore. The wise man smiled and said. You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem. Moral of the story. 
							Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy.</p>

					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>It was an incredibly hot day, and a lion was feeling very hungry. He came out of his den and searched here and there. He could find only a small rabbit. He caught the rabbit with some hesitation. “This rabbit can’t fill my stomach” thought the lion. As the lion was about to kill the rabbit, a deer ran that way. The lion became greedy. He thought Instead of eating this small rabbit, let me eat the big deer. He let the rabbit go and went behind the deer. But the deer had vanished into the forest. The lion now felt sorry for letting the rabbit off. 
							Moral of the story. 
							A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.</p>
